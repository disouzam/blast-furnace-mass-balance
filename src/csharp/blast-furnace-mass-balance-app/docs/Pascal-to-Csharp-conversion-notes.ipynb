    "\n",
    "This document intends to explain the process of extraction of Pascal code excerpts to corresponding C# code. As the original work has been done in 2006 - explained here [Nostalgia and experience with programming languages](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/03-nostalgia-experience-programming-languages-alves-de-souza/), much of original code is not clearly understood right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides this notebook, a copy of formatted Pascal code has been made and added to docs folder to enable annotations directly in the Pascal code."
